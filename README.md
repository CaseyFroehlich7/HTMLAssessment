### HTML Assessment

### Description:
This assignment was a great opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the basics of HTML. I felt I was able to use more of my creative side and apply my own personal spin on this project. As a big Penn State Wrestling fan and the season just starting, I wanted to make the Nittany Lions the theme of my project. In doing so, I was exposed to different ways to formulate text, tables, and lists. I successfully created and tested links to access the homepages of both Penn State and their biggest rivals, the Iowa Hawkeyes. Lastly, I created a mock entry to win Penn State Wrestling season tickets which allowed me to use input text fields for personal information, drop-down options to allow the user to choose their favorite Penn State Wrestler, checkboxes indicating which team they enjoyed beating the most, and finally, a radio button was implemented so the user could choose their appropriate age bracket.
